    // IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
    // the code below is outside of the scope of the course. You can uncomment
    // it to get your code to compile. Be aware that the code is written
    // expecting that a field named "id" and a field named "constant" exist
    // in this class: if you name them differently, change also the code below
    // to make it work by just using the name of your choice instead of
    // "id"/"constant". If you don't have these fields in your
    // solution, then you should make sure that what you are doing is correct :)

    // - Implement your solution using the DefiniteDataFlowDomain.
    //   - What would happen if you used a PossibleDataFlowDomain instead? Think about it (or try it), but remember to deliver the Definite version.
    // - Keep it simple: track only integer values. Any non-integer values should be ignored.
    // - To test your implementation, you can use the inputs/cprop.imp file or define your own test cases.
    // - Refer to the Java test methods discussed in class and adjust them accordingly to work with your domain.
    // - How should integer constant values be propagated?
    //   - Consider the following code snippet:
    //       1. x = 1
    //       2. y = x + 2
    //     The expected output should be:
    //       1. [x,1]
    //       2. [x,1] [y,3]
    //   - How can you retrieve the constant value of `x` to use at program point 2?
    //   - When working with an object of type `Constant`, you can obtain its value by calling the `getValue()` method.
